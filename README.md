A fetching script for a cryptocurrency website. The AppleScript creates a TextEdit file that operates an idle loop continuosly calling an HTTP transfer 
code. The script calls the trading value of the specified cryptocurrency and prints it to the TextEdit file continuously in the background of a Macintosh 
computer.

 This project is officially deprecated. The host site actively changed their code during my attempts to establish a connection and collect historical data 
 and I care so little about crypto that I see no point in trying to keep up with the fight for a leading GHG emitting investment option. The code and data 
 herein is free to use for others interested in this topic.
